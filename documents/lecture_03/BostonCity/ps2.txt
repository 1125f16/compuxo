PS1 - Boston City Data
The final goal is to run an AWS node express web service that 
returns Boston city employees who earn more than $300000
We want you to learn how to debug so we will attack this problem
in several parts. 



Part 1 - First we set get node to read a local file called
bostonsmall.json. 
1) create a directory called BostonCity
2) put bostoncitydata.json file into this directory
3) cd BostonCity
4) open a Command window in this directory 
4) run "node read.js"
Notice that we can read a file as a string. We use
JSON.parse(str) to turn this into a JavaScript object.
   
Part 2 - Run a simple Web Server to host bostonsmall.json
In BostonCity run a Command window and do the following:
1) npm init
2) npm install http-server
3) http-server
You will now have a Web Server running on your machine
Find the IP address of your machine 
Open a browser and enter URL http://localhost:8080/bostonsmall.json
also substitute your IP for localhost to make sure its accessible.

Part 3 - We will run a node express server on port 9081 on your own machine
to get the bostonsmall.json. So now modify test.js so that when 
in your browser your type localhost:9081/mit  you get the local
file bostonsmall.json from your http-server web server. 
You'll need to change the options to the following:
 var options = {
        host: 'localhost',
	port: 8080
        path: '/bostonsmall.json'
    };

Part 4 using Part 3 return rows with salaries above 200000 
(use data in row[18]) 

Part 5
Modify test.js to hit the Boston City Web Site
    var options = {
        host: 'data.cityofboston.gov',
        path: '/api/views/sx2i-td3j/rows.json'
    };
return only rows with salaries above 300000
How many people have salaries above 300000


Part 6 - Now run the same node express server on AWS so that 
we can hit the Boston City Web Site and get salaries above
300000
