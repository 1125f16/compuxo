<h2>PS1 - Boston City Data</h2><br>
The final goal is to run an AWS node express web service that 
returns Boston city employees who earn more than $300000
We want you to learn how to debug so we will attack this problem
in several parts. First running on our local machine with local data. Only when we have debugged our code will we push it to AWS. <br>


<h3>
Part 1 - First we get node to read a local file called
bostonsmall.json. </h3><br>
<ul>
<li> create a directory called BostonCity</li>
<li> put bostoncitydata.json file into this directory</li>
<li> cd BostonCity</li>
<li> open a Command window in this directory </li>
<li> run "node read.js"</li>
</ul>
Notice that we can read a file as a string. We use
JSON.parse(str) to turn this into a JavaScript object.
  <br>
<h3>Part 2 - Run a simple Web Server to host bostonsmall.json</h3><br>
In BostonCity run a Command window and do the following:
<ul>
<li> npm </li>
<li> npm install http-server</li>
<li> http-server</li>
</ul>

You will now have a Web Server running on your machine
Find the IP address of your machine 
Open a browser and enter URL http://localhost:8080/bostonsmall.json
also substitute your IP for localhost to make sure its accessible.
<br>
<h3>
Part 3 - We will run a node express server on port 9081 on your own machine
to get the bostonsmall.json.</h3><br>
So now modify test.js so that when 
in your browser your type localhost:9081/mit  you get the local
file bostonsmall.json from your http-server web server. 
You'll need to change the options to the following:<br>
 var options = {
        host: 'localhost',
	port: 8080
        path: '/bostonsmall.json'
    };
<br><h3>
Part 4 using Part 3 return rows with salaries above 200000 
(use data in row[18]) </h3><br>

<br><h3>Part 5 Modify test.js to hit the Boston City Web Site</h3><br>
    var options = {
        host: 'data.cityofboston.gov',
        path: '/api/views/sx2i-td3j/rows.json'
    };<br>
return only rows with salaries above 300000
How many people have salaries above 300000


<h3>Part 6 - Now run the same node express server on AWS so that 
we can hit the Boston City Web Site and get salaries above
300000</h3>
