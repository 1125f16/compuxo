Take a sample presentation from the new version. The barebones samples is a good one. Use it as a template for your slides.

Changes are limited to the head, eg

	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">

		<title>reveal.js - Barebones</title>

		<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../css/reveal.min.css">
	</head>


and the script at the bottom

		<script src="../../js/reveal.min.js"></script>

		<script>

			Reveal.initialize();

		</script>

The only package we are adding is "analytics.js"

		<script src="../template/js/analytics.js"></script>
